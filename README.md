#3D-Var

The 3D-Var approach is used as implemented in the Data Assimilation component of the WRF framework. The basic ideas of variational data assimilation and specifically the WRF Data Assimilation (WRFDA) system is deeply discussed in Barker (2012). 

Among various data assimilation methods, the variational approaches have been widely used in meteorology, specifically the method 3D-Var. In the 3D-Var approach, a cost function is defined which is proportional to the square of the distance between the analysis and both the background and observations (Kalnay,2003).

#TensorFlow

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.[4] It is used for both research and production at Google.
